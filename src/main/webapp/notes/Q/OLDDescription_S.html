The FAOSTAT GHG Agriculture database provides country-level estimates of GHG emissions based on FAOSTAT activity data and using Tier 1 computations following 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines. Technical details of specific activity data used and relevant computational steps employed are given in the <i>Methodology and Quality Information</i> section of the metadata associated to each of the sectors in the domain.
<br><br>
GHG Emissions from agriculture are dominated by non-CO<sub style='font-size: 8px;'>2</sub> gases methane (CH<sub style='font-size: 8px;'>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub style='font-size: 8px;'>2</sub>O) from crop and livestock production and management activities. Sources of carbon emissions are mainly those from cultivated organic soils, reported in the land use, land use change and forestry domain under cropland. 
<br><br>
Results from the FAOSTAT GHG Agriculture database contribute to IPCC WGIII Fifth Assessment Report, extending trend analysis of activity data and GHG emissions to the present time, as well as ensuring annual automatic updates in following years. In particular, from 1990 to 2000, agricultural emissions have increased by 0.7 percent annually, accelerating to 1.1 percent yr-1 in the most recent decade of 2000-2010. At the same time, the ratio of agriculture to fossil fuel emissions decreased from 17.2 percent in 2000 to 13.7 percent in 2010.

Currently the GHG Agriculture domain in FAOSTAT includes the sectors listed above: Cultivated Organic Soils and Crop Residue Burning will be included very soon.
