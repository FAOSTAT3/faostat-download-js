    <b>Land-use statistics</b>
    <br/>
    <br/>Data on agricultural land-use are valuable for conducting studies on a various perspectives concerning agricultural production, food security and for deriving cropping intensity among others uses. Indicators derived from the land-use categories can also elucidate the environmental sustainability of countries’ agricultural practices. FAOSTAT Land-use statistics contain a wide range of information on variables that are significant for: understanding the structure of a country’s agricultural sector; making economic plans and policies for food security; deriving environmental indicators, including those related to investment in agriculture and data on gross crop area and net crop area which are useful for policy formulation and monitoring.

    <br/><br/>
    <b>Land-use Inputs sub-domain covers:</b>
    <br/><br/>
    Country area (including area under inland water bodies), Land area (excluding area under inland water bodies), Agricultural area, Arable land and Permanent crops, Arable land, Permanent crops, Permanent meadows and pastures, Forest area, Inland water, Other land and Area equipped for irrigation. Data are available from 1961 onwards for more than 200 countries and areas. Detailed data for sub-categories are also available (starting year 2001): Temporary crops, Temporary meadows and pastures, Fallow land (temporary: less than 5 years), Permanent meadows and pastures cultivated and naturally growing as well as Organic land (starting year 2004)and Area of arable land and permanent crops under protective cover (starting year 2007).<br/><br/>

    <b>Forest area</b>: Global Forest Resource Assessment 2010 (FRA 2010) is the main source of forest area data in FAOSTAT. Data were provided by countries for years 1990, 2000, 2005 and 2010. Data for intermediate years were estimated for FAO using linear interpolation and tabulation.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Questionnaire</b>
    <br/><br/>
    The annual FAO land use and irrigation questionnaire is the primary source of country land-use data. The data collected from the questionnaires are from official national sources. Starting from 2001, the land-use questionnaire was revised in order to obtain further information on the land-use sub-categories as well as areas that are actually irrigated. Starting in 2010, the FAO Statistics Division Land use and irrigation questionnaire includes items on land used for organic production and land in conversion to organic production. The new items are: agricultural area certified organic, agricultural area in conversion to organic, arable area organic, arable area in conversion to organic, permanent crops area organic, permanent crops in conversion to organic, permanent meadows and pastures area organic and permanent meadows and pastures in conversion to organic. If official data about Organic land have not been provided, the information has been supplemented by other sources such as the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture FiBL and the Mediterranean Organic Agriculture Network, MOAN. In Annual questionnaire 2013, it was introduced the data collection on Area of arable land and permanent crops under protective cover.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Secondary sources</b>
    <br/><br/>
    The data collected from official national sources through the questionnaire are supplemented with information from official secondary data sources. The secondary sources cover: official country data from websites of national ministries, national publications and related country data reported by various international organizations.

    <p><strong>American Samoa:</strong><br />
        Due to the use of different data sources and overlaps in definitions and classifications, the sum of individual land use category data may exceed &quot;total land area&quot;. Examples of such instances include forest and agriculture land with tree cover - such as rubber plantations, permanent tree crops, range land and agro-forestry and shifting cultivation areas.</p><br />

<p><strong>Germany:</strong><br>
The country data on "Forest area" reported to the Global Forest Resource Assessment (FRA) and the FAO land resource questionnaire differ slightly due to different concepts and definition. However, we display the data reported to FRA since FAO member countries are requested officially to report information on forest area through the FRA process, where a common definition is used for all the countries. The "Agricultural area" excludes the area under bogs and heaths which is about 1782 (1000&nbsp;ha) in the year 2004, 1746 (1000&nbsp;ha) in the year 2008, 1668 (1000&nbsp;ha) in 2009, 1836 (1000&nbsp;ha) in 2010, 1801(1000&nbsp;ha) in 2011 and 1827 (1000&nbsp;ha) in 2012.

"Agricultural area": it includes agricultural areas other than the utilized agricultural area (UAA) such as: agricultural area in scattered forests, pastures in forests and summer pastures.  <br>"Permanent meadows and pastures – naturally growing":  it is calculated as a residual:  “Agricultural area”-(“Arable land and Permanent crops”+“Permanent meadows and pastures – Cultivated”). The summer pastures occupy most of the area under this category; however the “Permanent meadows and pastures – naturally growing” (and its main land use category “Permanent meadows and pastures”) may include pastures in forests and other agricultural areas. This methodological issue should be taken into consideration in data analysis (for instance, annual change should be interpreted with caution and it would be appropriate to consider trends over a 5-10 years period).<br>
"Agricultural area organic, total": it refers to organic area in the agricultural utilized area (UAA). </p><br>
