<h1>Global Food Security Indicators</h1><br>
Following the recommendation of experts gathered in the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) Round Table on hunger measurement, hosted at FAO headquarters in September 2011, an initial set of indicators aiming to capture various aspects of food insecurity is presented here. 
<br/><br/>
The choice of the indicators has been informed by expert judgment and the availability of data with sufficient coverage to enable comparisons across regions and over time. Many of these indicators are produced and published elsewhere by FAO and other international organizations. They are reported here in a single database with the aim of building a wide food security information system. More indicators will be added to this set as more data will become available.
<br/><br/>
Indicators are classified along the four dimension of food security -- availability, access, utilization and stability. To further facilitate their interpretation they are also classified as indicators of determinants and outcomes of food insecurity. Determinants, which can be either static or dynamic, refer to structural conditions that worsen food insecurity in absence of adequate policy interventions, including emergency assistance. Outcome indicators capture results in terms of inadequate food consumption or anthropometric failures.

<h1>Indicators from Household Surveys (gender, area, socioeconomics)</h1><br>
Food security statistics derived from National Household Surveys are disseminated for 43 surveys (partial coverage for each region). Estimates are provided at the national and sub-national level, that is, by region, area of residence and for socio-demographic and economic groups. 
<br/><br/>
The database devotes special attention to gender-relevant groups. In fact, all the indicators are disaggregated by: 1) sex of the household head, 2) region of residence, 3) sex of the household head and region of residence, 4) urban or rural area of residence, 5) sex of the household head and area of residence, 6) household size, 7) sex of the household head and household size, 8) age of the household head, 9) age and sex of the household head, 10) income terciles, 11) sex of the household head and terciles of income, 12) dependency rate, 13) sex of the household head and dependency rate, 14) presence of children under 5 years, 15) sex of the household head and presence of children under 5 years, 16) gender composition, 17) education of the household head, 18) education and sex of the household head, 19) education of adult women in the household.
<br/><br/>
The database reports the mean, the median, the standard deviation and the number of observations for each of the food security statistics. If the number of observation is less than 100, the statistical coefficients are not reported and the corresponding cell is empty.
<br/><br/>
All the food security statistics disseminated through this database are derived from the food and non-food consumption (or acquisition) data collected in National Household Surveys implemented by countries, including household budget surveys, living standard measurement surveys, and others. Although data are collected at the household level and the reference period depend on the survey design, all the food security statistics are expressed per person and per day. The definitions and unit of measurement of each food security statistic is described in the table below.
<br/><br/>
During the past decade, the FAO Statistics Division has developed a standard methodology for analyzing food consumption data collected through National Household Surveys. A free software was developed to facilitate the analysis of micro data called ADePT Food Security Statistics Module in collaboration with the World Bank and under the auspices of the European Union’s “Improved Global Governance for Hunger Reduction Programme”.

Share of food consumption in total income (%) 
			</td>
			<td>
This indicator is an estimate of the proportion of total income devoted to food. It is known as Engel ratio that tends to be higher among the poor households as they prioritize acquisition of primary need goods and limit the expenses on the other items. However, it tends to be lower among the wealthier households because they increase the expenditures on non-necessary and luxury non-food items. The indicator is expressed as percentage (%).
