<p>Agriculture Total contains all the emissions produced in the different agricultural emissions sub-domains, providing a picture of the contribution to the total amount of GHG emissions from agriculture. GHG emissions from agriculture consist of non-CO2 gases, namely methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), produced by crop and livestock production and management activities. Computed at Tier 1 following IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories; available by country, with global coverage and relative to the period 1990 to present, with annual updates, and projections for 2030 and 2050.</p>
