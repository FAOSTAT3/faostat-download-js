The Fertilizer Trade Values contains data from 1961 onwards. This dataset has been prepared from detailed fertilizer imports and exports statistics reported by national statistical authorities, The United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN Comtrade) and Eurostat. All values are in 1000 US Dollars (1000 $). Please note that differences between exports and imports are mainly due to: 




<br/>
<ul class='bullet-list'>
	<li>the time lag between the date when the exports are recorded and the date of their entry into the importing countries; 
</li>
	<li>the time reference period: some exporting countries report for the calendar year while the corresponding importing countries report for the fertilizer year, and vice versa; 
;</li>
	<li>the different statistical systems used in reporting intermediate material.</li>
</ul>
