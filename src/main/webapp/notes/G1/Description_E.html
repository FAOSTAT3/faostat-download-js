    The FAOSTAT Emissions Agriculture database provides country-level estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on FAOSTAT activity data and using Tier 1 computations, following 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. Technical details of specific activity data used and relevant computational steps employed are given in the <i>Methodology and Quality Information</i> section of the metadata for each of the sectors in the domain.
<br><br>
    GHG Emissions from agriculture are dominated by non-CO<sub>2</sub> gases methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) from crop and livestock production and management activities. Sources of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions are mainly those from cultivation of organic soils, reported in the FAOSTAT Emissions Land Use domain, consistently with IPCC.
<br><br>
    The FAOSTAT Emissions Agriculture data contribute to IPCC WGIII Fifth Assessment Report, extending trend analysis of activity data and GHG emissions to the present time, as well as ensuring annual automatic updates in following years.
<br><br>
    The FAOSTAT Emissions database provides support to FAO member countries, along four key dimensions of use:
<ul class='bullet-list'>
	<li>Regular updates of global and regional trends in GHG emissions from agriculture, forestry  and land use;</li>
	<li>Capacity development of member countries towards improved analysis of GHG emissions and identification of data gaps;</li>
	<li>Quality Control and Quality Assurance procedures for GHG Inventories;</li>
	<li>Development of indicators linking GHG emissions to their underlying commodities.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>DISCLAIMER:</b> The FAOSTAT Emissions data are estimates by FAO and do not coincide with GHG data reported by member countries to UNFCCC. The database is intended primarily as a service to help member countries assess and report their emissions, as well as a useful international benchmark. The FAOSTAT Emissions data are disseminated publicly to facilitate continuous feedback from member countries.
