In the year 1995 the price series in FAOSTAT were interrupted due to resource constraints. The data collection work was re-initiated a few years after. At the moment, the Producer Prices Domain contains data from 1991 onwards, whilst the Price Archive Domain contains historical data from 1966 to 1990. Due to a lack of resources, the FAO Statistics Division was not able to carry out the harmonization work. Therefore, for various known reasons, the two datasets may differ and the FAO Statistics Division is not in a position to give any explanation for the existing differences. Users using a combination of the two datasets should keep this limitation in mind.
