    The FAOSTAT Emissions Land Use database provides country-level estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on FAOSTAT activity data using Tier 1 computations, following 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National GHG Inventories. Technical details of specific activity data used and relevant computational steps employed, including the mapping between IPCC and FAOSTAT land use categories, are given in the Methodology and Quality Information section of the metadata for each of the sectors in the domain.
    <br><br>
    Changes in carbon stocks and ecosystem function linked to anthropogenic activities such as land-use change and land management determine emissions and removals of GHG that are typically reported by countries under the IPCC Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) categories. In general, activities that increase terrestrial carbon stocks over time lead to removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, while activities that decrease total carbon stocks lead to CO2 and non-CO2 emissions.
    <br><br>
    The current database includes CO2 emissions by sources and removals by sinks from forest land, cropland and grassland, as well as emissions of non-CO2 from fires of biomass and organic soils.
    <br><br>
    Results from the FAOSTAT Emissions Land Use database contribute to IPCC WGIII Fifth Assessment Report, extending trend analysis of activity data and GHG emissions to the present time, with annual automatic updates in following years.
    <br><br>
    The FAOSTAT Emissions database provides support to FAO member countries along four key dimensions of use:
    <ul class='bullet-list'>
        <li>Regular updates of global and regional trends in GHG emissions from agriculture, forestry  and land use;</li>
        <li>Capacity development of member countries towards improved analysis of GHG emissions and identification of data gaps;</li>
        <li>Quality Control and Quality Assurance procedures for GHG Inventories;</li>
        <li>Development of indicators linking GHG emissions to their underlying commodities.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <b>DISCLAIMER:</b> The FAOSTAT Emissions data are estimates by FAO and do not coincide with GHG data reported by member countries to UNFCCC. The database is intended primarily as a service to help member countries assess and report their emissions, as well as a useful international benchmark. The FAOSTAT Emissions data are disseminated publicly to facilitate continuous feedback from member countries.
