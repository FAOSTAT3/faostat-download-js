The FAOSTAT Emissions Agriculture database provides country-level estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on FAOSTAT activity data and using Tier 1 computations, following 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. Technical details of specific activity data used and relevant computational steps employed are given in the <em>Methodology and Quality Information</em> section of the metadata for each of the sectors in the domain.
<br><br>
GHG Emissions from agriculture are dominated by non-CO<sub>2</sub> gases methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) from crop and livestock production and management activities. Sources of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions are mainly those from cultivation of organic soils, reported in the FAOSTAT Emissions Land Use domain consistently with IPCC.
<br><br>
The FAOSTAT Emissions Agriculture data contribute to IPCC WGIII Fifth Assessment Report, extending trend analysis of activity data and GHG emissions to the present time, with annual automatic updates. 
<br><br>
The FAOSTAT Emissions database can provide significant support to FAO member countries, along four key dimensions:
<ul class='bullet-list'>
	<li>Regular updates of global and regional trends in GHG emissions from agriculture, forestry  and land use;</li>
	<li>Capacity development of member countries towards improved analysis of GHG emissions and identification of data gaps;</li>
	<li>Quality Control and Quality Assurance procedures for GHG Inventories;</li>
	<li>Development of indicators linking GHG emissions to their underlying commodities.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>DISCLAIMER:</b> DISCLAIMER: The FAOSTAT Emissions data are estimated by FAO and do not coincide with GHG data reported by member countries to UNFCCC. The database is intended primarily as a service to help member countries assess and report their emissions, as well as a useful international benchmark. The FAOSTAT Emissions data are disseminated publicly to facilitate continuous feedback from member countries.
