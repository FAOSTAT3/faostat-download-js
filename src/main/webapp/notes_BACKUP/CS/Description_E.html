The FAO Statistics Division new series of Capital stock in Agriculture is based on 2005 constant prices. The dataset covers the period 1975 to 2007 for approximately 200 countries with more than 5000 hectare of agricultural land. Data on quantity of physical assets “in use” have been collected from the member countries and the same are multiplied by 2005 (purchasers) price to get estimates of gross capital stock in agriculture. The concept of agriculture refers to the activity of crop and animal husbandry (i.e. the estimates do not include forestry and fishery sub-sectors or greenhouse production structures). The physical assets include assets used in the production process covering land development, irrigation works, structures, machinery and livestock.
